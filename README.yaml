  Once the catalog file is created, the file can be imported as follows.

  ```yaml
  import:
    - catalog/eks/cert-manager
    ...
  ```

  The default catalog values `e.g. stacks/catalog/eks/cert-manager.yaml`

  ```yaml
  enabled: true
  name: cert-manager
  kubernetes_namespace: cert-manager
  # `helm_manifest_experiment_enabled` does not work with cert-manager or any Helm chart that uses CRDs
  helm_manifest_experiment_enabled: false
  # Use the cert-manager as a private CA (Certificate Authority)
  # to issue certificates for use within the Kubernetes cluster.
  # Something like this is required for the ALB Ingress Controller.
  cert_manager_issuer_selfsigned_enabled: true
  # Use Let's Encrypt to issue certificates for use outside the Kubernetes cluster,
  # ones that will be trusted by browsers.
  # These do not (yet) work with the ALB Ingress Controller,
  # which require ACM certificates, so we have no use for them.
  letsencrypt_enabled: true
  # cert_manager_issuer_support_email_template is only used if letsencrypt_enabled is true.
  # If it were true, we would want to set it at the organization level.
  cert_manager_issuer_support_email_template: "aws+%s@acme.com"
